## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Navigation and Active States:** 
   - Consolidated menu items detect if user is on any of the merged pages
   - `isActive` property now includes multiple location checks

2. **Logical Grouping:**
   - Content-related functions grouped together
   - User-related functions grouped together
   - Analytics and reports grouped together

3. **Maintaining Functionality:**
   - Each menu option maintains its original functionality
   - Clicking a consolidated menu item takes you to the main page of that group
   - Example: Clicking "Content Management" leads to /admin/content

## Verification Method
Since the admin menu appears to be rendered client-side in React, traditional HTML inspection won't show the changes. To verify:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Check the sidebar for the new consolidated menu structure
3. Click menu items to confirm navigation works correctly
4. The active state should highlight correctly when visiting any page from the merged group

## Expected Benefits
- Cleaner, more organized admin interface
- Improved information architecture
- Easier navigation with logical groupings
- Reduced cognitive load for administrators
