# Fix Workflow Configuration for Web Application Feedback

## Problem
The workflow 'Start application' isn't setup to wait for a port so web application feedback will not work. The `mark_completed_and_get_feedback` tool requires the workflow to be configured with `wait_for_port`.

## Solution
You need to manually edit the `.replit` file to add the `wait_for_port` configuration to the "Start application" workflow.

### Current Configuration (Lines 49-58 in .replit):
```toml
[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Start application"
author = "agent"

[workflows.workflow.metadata]
agentRequireRestartOnSave = false

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "npm run dev"
```

### Fixed Configuration (add wait_for_port line):
```toml
[[workflows.workflow]]
name = "Start application"
author = "agent"

[workflows.workflow.metadata]
agentRequireRestartOnSave = false

[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
task = "shell.exec"
args = "npm run dev"
wait_for_port = 3003
```

## Instructions
1. Open the `.replit` file in your editor
2. Find the "Start application" workflow section (around line 49)
3. Add `wait_for_port = 3003` to the `[[workflows.workflow.tasks]]` section
4. Save the file
5. Restart the workflow

## Server Details
- **Port**: 3003 (confirmed working)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0
- **Status**: ✅ Server is running and responding correctly
- **Command**: `npm run dev` (runs `tsx server/index.ts`)

## Alternative Ports
The server is configured to try alternative ports if 3003 is unavailable:
- 3004, 3005, 3006, 3007, 3008

## Verification
After making the change, the `mark_completed_and_get_feedback` tool should work properly and be able to:
- Capture screenshots of the running application
- Check workflow logs and status
- Provide proper web application feedback

## Current Project Status
✅ Background image removal completed successfully
✅ Server running on port 3003 without issues
✅ WordPress API integration working (23 posts synced)
✅ All core functionality preserved
⚠️ Only the workflow configuration needs this manual fix
