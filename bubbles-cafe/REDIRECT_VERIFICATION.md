# Data Export Redirection Verification

## Testing Instructions

This document provides instructions for manually verifying the data export redirection and improved authentication error handling.

### 1. Testing the Data Export Redirection

**Steps:**
1. Log in to the application using valid credentials
2. Navigate to `/settings/data-export` (either by typing the URL or using a link)
3. Verify that:
   - You are automatically redirected to `/settings/privacy`
   - A toast notification appears with the message "Data Export Feature Removed"
   - The notification explains that support should be contacted for data needs

**Expected Results:**
- Immediate redirection occurs
- Toast notification appears and is clearly visible
- No errors are shown in the console

### 2. Testing Authentication Error Handling

**Steps:**
1. Clear your browser cookies or use an incognito/private window
2. Navigate directly to `/settings/privacy`
3. Observe the login screen and authentication flow
4. After login, verify you can access the privacy settings
5. In a separate test, try accessing privacy settings with an expired token
   - This can be simulated by modifying the token in local storage or cookies
   - Or by waiting for token expiration if using short-lived tokens

**Expected Results:**
- Proper redirect to login when not authenticated
- After successful authentication, redirect back to intended page
- For expired tokens, clear error message shown via toast notification
- User is prompted to log in again

### 3. Verifying Privacy Settings Updates

**Steps:**
1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Navigate to Privacy Settings
3. Change a setting (e.g., toggle "Profile Visibility")
4. Clear cookies while page is still open
5. Try to save settings again

**Expected Results:**
- First save should work normally with success toast
- After clearing cookies, attempting to save should:
  - Display an authentication required toast
  - Not trigger the generic "Failed to update" message
  - Maintain appropriate error state in the UI

## Implementation Verification Checklist

- [x] Client-side redirect implemented in App.tsx
- [x] Toast notification configuration working correctly
- [x] Privacy settings hook enhanced with improved error handling
- [x] Authentication failures (401 errors) handled appropriately
- [x] No remaining references to data export functionality in UI
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect the changes

## Notes for Developers

- The redirection is implemented client-side using React Router (wouter)
- Toast notifications are displayed using the Sonner library
- Authentication error handling has been enhanced throughout the privacy settings flows
- The implementation aims to provide a seamless user experience despite the removed functionality
