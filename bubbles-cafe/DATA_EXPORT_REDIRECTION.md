# Data Export Redirection Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of redirection from the removed data export functionality to the privacy settings page, along with improved authentication error handling throughout the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Client-Side Redirection Implementation

We've implemented a client-side redirect in `App.tsx` that:
- Intercepts any attempt to access `/settings/data-export`
- Displays a toast notification informing the user that the data export feature has been removed
- Redirects the user to `/settings/privacy` page

```jsx
<Route path="/settings/data-export">
  {() => {
    const [, setLocation] = useLocation();
    React.useEffect(() => {
      // Show toast notification
      toast.error("Data Export Feature Removed", {
        description: "The data export functionality has been removed. Please contact support if you need your data."
      });
      // Redirect to privacy settings page
      setLocation('/settings/privacy');
    }, [setLocation]);
    // Return null while redirecting
    return null;
  }}
</Route>
```

### 2. Enhanced Privacy Settings Error Handling

The `use-privacy-settings.ts` hook has been updated to handle authentication errors more gracefully:

```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  // Handle authentication errors specially
  if (response.status === 401) {
    toast({
      title: 'Authentication required',
      description: 'Your session has expired. Please log in again to update your privacy settings',
      variant: 'destructive',
    });
  }
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch privacy settings: ${response.status}`);
}
```

This improvement has been applied to both fetching and updating privacy settings, ensuring consistent behavior.

### 3. Testing and Verification

We've created test scripts to verify the implementation:
- A simple browser test that navigates to the data export page and checks for redirects
- A reminder script that serves as documentation for our implementation approach

The client-side redirect approach was chosen because:
1. It provides a better user experience with immediate feedback via toast notification
2. It keeps the redirection logic in the frontend where the routes are defined
3. It allows us to provide contextual information about the feature removal

## Verification

This implementation has been verified to:
- Successfully redirect users from the data export page to privacy settings
- Display appropriate toast notifications explaining the change
- Handle authentication errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Provide consistent behavior across the application

## Future Considerations

For long-term maintenance, consider:
- Implementing server-side redirects for any direct API calls to data export endpoints
- Adding logging to track attempts to access removed functionality
- Ensuring documentation is updated to remove references to data export functionality
