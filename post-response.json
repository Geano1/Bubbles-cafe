{"id":16,"title":"Nostalgia","content":"Nostalgia is disgusting.\n\nIt is a slimy, writhing worm in your brain you can’t reach. A parasite that gnaws at your sanity.\n\nYou’ve tried to grasp it but it moves around your brain and distorts your memory horribly. You remember people and miss them, their flaws fade in the warmth of fond memories. You forget their vile nature.\n\nIn your memories they are flawless, perfect.\n\nThe songs you listened to, the sunset you both witnessed, the jokes you shared-now it crawls around your memories like a dirty maggot distorting it.\n\nYou’ve begun to forget the bad memories.\n\nYou try so hard to remember but it squirms under your skin, burrows behind your eyes.\n\nYou must dig it out. Claw at your flesh.\n\nNostalgia whispers, urging you to send them a text, call, see how they are doing.\n\n“It’s been a while” It says.\n\nNo. No? No!\n\nIt’s been trying for days to dig deeper into your brain. It has taken over your thoughts.\n\nIt hurts so badly. It’s torment, excruciating pain.\n\nYou want to forget everything, purge your flesh.\n\nUse a hammer. Crush it.","excerpt":"Nostalgia is disgusting.","slug":"nostalgia","authorId":1,"isSecret":false,"matureContent":false,"themeCategory":null,"readingTimeMinutes":1,"likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"metadata":{},"createdAt":"2024-07-12T22:05:24.000Z"}
