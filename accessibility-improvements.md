# Accessibility Improvements for Feedback System

## Current Status
The feedback form has basic form elements with labels and validation, but lacks several important accessibility features that would make it more usable for people with disabilities.

## Required Improvements

### 1. Add ARIA Attributes
- Add `aria-invalid="true"` to form inputs when they contain validation errors
- Add `aria-describedby` to connect error messages with their respective input fields
- Add `aria-required="true"` to all required fields
- Add `aria-live="polite"` to the error message container to announce errors to screen readers

### 2. Improve Form Validation Feedback
- Ensure error messages are programmatically associated with inputs
- Add clear focus management that moves focus to the first error field when validation fails
- Add `role="alert"` to validation summary for important errors

### 3. Enhance Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable in a logical sequence
- Add focus styling that is visible and meets contrast requirements
- Ensure the star rating component can be operated with keyboard alone

### 4. Provide Clear Instructions
- Add descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all inputs
- Add clear instructions at the beginning of the form
- Ensure required fields are clearly marked (visually and programmatically)

### 5. Improve Reading Order
- Ensure the reading order matches the visual order of the form
- Group related form controls with `fieldset` and `legend` elements
- Add skip links for longer forms

### 6. Color and Contrast
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information (add icons or text)
- Provide high contrast focus indicators

### 7. Status Messages
- Make status messages (loading, success, error) accessible with `role="status"` and `aria-live`
- Use appropriate ARIA roles for different types of messages

## Implementation Plan
1. Start by adding ARIA attributes to existing form elements
2. Enhance error handling and validation feedback mechanisms
3. Test with keyboard-only navigation
4. Add missing accessibility features from the list above
5. Run automated testing tools (like axe or Lighthouse)
6. Manual testing with screen readers

## Expected Impact
These improvements will make the feedback form accessible to:
- Screen reader users
- Keyboard-only users
- Users with cognitive disabilities
- Users with low vision
- Users with motor impairments
