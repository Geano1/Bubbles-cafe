{"id":15,"title":"Cave","content":"Journal Entry - May 21, 2004_.\n\nFor the past five months I have been exploring the perimeter of the caves. They fascinate me. I’m enticed to explore within.\n\nIn the depths of the cave a fallen god casts an imposing figure, surrounded by six statues in eternal reverence. They kneel facing it, heads bent to the earth. Their twisted forms bear witness to aeons of ancient devotion. Bleeding eyes fixed on its feet. The fallen god is a monolithic deity, a relic of another time long forgotten.\n\nAmong the bones scattered across the cavern floor, it lies in the center of the cave, tethered by vein-like wires pulsating with unearthly energy.\n\nIt has three heads, each displaying three different emotions, they have one thing in common. The eyes are gouged out.\n\nI am tempted to touch its feet.\n\n_I can’t resist.\n\nDespite the warning whispers echoing in my mind, I succumb to temptation, reaching out to touch the god’s cold, blood-streaked surface.\n\nThere is a vicious screeching in my ears.\n\n_Bow down, worship, pay homage.\n\nThe pain brings me to my knees\n\nBows my head to the earth.\n\nMy eyes bleed and so do my ears.\n\nVisions of hellfire and damnation flicker before my eyes, each scene more horrifying than the last.\n\nI see myself die in countless ways.\n\nMy essence is drained, consumed by the insatiable hunger of the fallen deity.\n\nIt drinks up my blood faster than I can bleed.\n\nMy body succumbs, petrifies, morphing into the seventh statue, the earth beneath me trembles in acknowledgment and I only feel it for a moment before everything goes dark.\n\n_End of entry.","excerpt":"Journal Entry - May 21, 2004_.","slug":"cave","authorId":1,"isSecret":false,"matureContent":false,"themeCategory":null,"readingTimeMinutes":2,"likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"metadata":{},"createdAt":"2024-04-22T20:15:27.000Z"}
