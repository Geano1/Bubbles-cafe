2. Game Concept

	Eden’s Hollow is a branching narrative game featuring five standalone horror storylines. Each story unfolds through immersive prose and choice-based gameplay, with sanity and corruption mechanics affecting decisions and outcomes.

Core Mechanics
	•	Choice-Based Gameplay: Players read text and make choices that affect the narrative.
	•	Sanity Meter: Visible sanity/corruption gauge that influences available choices and paths.
	•	Branching Paths: Every choice can lead to new scenes, consequences, or endings.
	•	Amazing Visuals: Focus is on also atmosphere, text, and sound.
	•	Retry Mechanic: Occasionally prompts like “Are you truly sure you want to go down this path?” give players one last moment to reconsider.
	•	Permadeath: Rare, but possible in specific bad-ending paths.
    Narrative Structure
	•5 standalone Storylines:
	
Each story is self-contained, with its own:
	•	Protagonist
	•	Sanity events
	•	Endings
	•	Tone and themes

5. Interface & UX
	•	Start Screen: Choose a storyline
	•	Game Screen: Story text + choices
	•	Sanity Meter: Always visible
	•	Dark Fantasy Theme: Vampyr, Dark souls 3, Valheim inspired.
	•	Responsive Design: Mobile & desktop friendly
	1. Sanity Meter
    * Visual representation (0-100 scale)
    * Dynamic changes based on player choices
    * Affects available options (choices locked/unlocked based on sanity)
    * Visual effects that intensify as sanity decreases
2. Choice System
    * Standard choices affecting narrative progression
    * "Are you truly sure?" moments for critical decisions
    * Rare permadeath paths in specific bad endings
3. Typewriter Text Effect
    * Characters appear sequentially with timing control
    * Skippable with "Skip" button
    * Sound effects synchronized with text appearance
    Narrative Structure
1. Five Standalone Storylines
    * Each with its own protagonist, sanity events, endings, tone and themes
    * Built according to the 5-part progression model from the reference text:
        * Introduction: The Normal Cracks
        * Descent: Fractures in Reality
        * Fragmentation: The Mind Breaks Open
        * Confrontation: The Truth or the Lie
        * Endings: Multiplicity of Madness
2. Branching Narrative System
    * Choice-based progression
    * Diverging story paths based on decisions
    * Conditional branching based on sanity levels
    * Multiple endings per storyline
    I want titles and premises that are:
	•	Elegant but unnerving
	•	Nonlinear in implication (so the player doesn’t guess the plot)
	•	Heavy with metaphor, but still personal
	•	Atmospheric and symbolic (think: Kafka meets House of Leaves meets slow rot in velvet wallpaper)
    The writing should feel deeply immersive — like the protagonist is slowly losing their mind. Dialogue and narration should feel human, paranoid, poetic, and unstable.
I want help making the game feel:
• Deeply atmospheric, unsettling from the first sentence
• Narratively rich, with strong internal monologue and sharp, realistic dialogue
• Beautifully written, with vivid, haunting prose that adapts to choices
• Emotionally disturbing, with story arcs that stick with the player long after
