Given that you're building an admin dashboard for a short story writing website using PostgreSQL, and you need features for managing community posts and comments, here's a more tailored approach:

### 1. Content Management

#### Objective
- Manage short stories: Add, Edit, Delete, List

#### Implementation Steps

**a. Database Setup**

1. **Create the Database Table**
   - Design a table named `stories` with the following columns:
     - `id` (Primary Key, Serial)
     - `title` (VARCHAR)
     - `content` (TEXT)
     - `author` (VARCHAR)
     - `publication_date` (TIMESTAMP)

2. **Initialize the Database**
   - Use SQL scripts to create the `stories` table if it doesn't exist.

**b. Views and Forms**

1. **List Stories**
   - Create an admin page to list all stories with columns for `Title`, `Author`, `Publication Date`, and action buttons for `Edit` and `Delete`.

2. **Add Story**
   - Develop a form with fields for `Title` and `Content`. Use a rich text editor for the content field.
   - Implement a submit button to save the new story.

3. **Edit Story**
   - Create a form pre-populated with existing story data for editing.
   - Include a submit button to update the story.

4. **Delete Story**
   - Provide a confirmation dialog before deleting a story to prevent accidental deletions.

**c. Security**

1. **Authentication**

**b. Views and Forms**

1. **List Users**
   - Create a page to list all users with their roles and options to edit or delete.

2. **Edit User**
   - Develop a form to edit user roles.

3. **Delete User**
   - Include a confirmation step before deleting a user.

**c. Security**
