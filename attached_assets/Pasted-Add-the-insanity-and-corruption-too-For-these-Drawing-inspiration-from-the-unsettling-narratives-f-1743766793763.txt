Separate standalone, a player should choose upfront, visible sanity meter, yes- certain choices should be locked/unlocked based on sanity levels, some choices lead to subtle, creeping horror, while others result in instant consequences, there be permadeath scenarios but very few, based on factors some players should be able to retry decisions.. for example after clicking a choice that is really terrible for them there can be a prompt like “are you truly sure you want to go down this path?, I Would like you to help outline a choice flowchart for each storyline, it should alternate between short, immersive prose and dialogue between the narrator or story guide/decision guide.
A visual flowchart is better for tracking branching paths, but a detailed text outline helps refine narrative beats before mapping them out.

I’ll first draft a detailed text outline for The Word That Unravels, then translate it into a flowchart for clarity.

Plan:
	1.	Draft a structured outline (Intro → Key Choices → Sanity Effects → Critical Events → Endings).
	2.	Review & refine it with you.
	3.	Convert it into a visual flowchart.

I’ll start drafting the outline now!
