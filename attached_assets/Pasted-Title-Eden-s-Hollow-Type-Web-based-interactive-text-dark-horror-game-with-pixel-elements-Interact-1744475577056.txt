# Eden’s Hollow: Interactive Horror Game

An immersive, web-based dark fantasy text game with branching narratives and sanity mechanics. 

Each of the five stories is standalone, featuring unique horror plots, character arcs, and decision consequences.

We use a sanity meter to dynamically lock/unlock choices and alter the flow of the story.

This is meant to have amazing visuals and very terrifying novel. Just deeply immersive horror.

1. Overall Game Concept
Eden's Hollow is a branching narrative dark fantasy horror game with five standalone storylines, each designed to feel unsettling and psychologically terrifying. The game will feature:
* Choice-based gameplay with branching narratives
* A visible sanity meter affecting available choices and paths
* Deeply atmospheric, unsettling prose
* Typewriter-style text effect
* Background sound and ambient effects
* Integration with the existing sidebar menu
2. Technical Architecture
Frontend Integration
1. Web-Based Implementation
    * Use a hybrid approach that integrates Löve2D (for game mechanics) within the web application
    * Embed the Löve2D game canvas in a React component for the web interface
2. Routing & Navigation
    * Update the existing /eden-game route in App.tsx to point to our new game component
    * Keep the existing sidebar menu entry "Eden - Experimental Game"
Game Engine Implementation
1. Löve2D Core Game Engine
    * Create a modular Löve2D structure with:
        * main.lua - Entry point
        * game_state.lua - Game state management
        * ui.lua - UI components (sanity meter, choices)
        * typewriter.lua - Text rendering with typewriter effect
        * audio.lua - Sound effects and ambient audio system
2. Story Structure
    * Define a data structure for the narrative content
    * Implement storyline parser and scene manager
    * Create state management for tracking player choices and sanity
3. Core Game Features
Narrative Structure
1. Five Standalone Storylines
    * Each with its own protagonist, sanity events, endings, tone and themes
    * Built according to the 5-part progression model from the reference text:
        * Introduction: The Normal Cracks
        * Descent: Fractures in Reality
        * Fragmentation: The Mind Breaks Open
        * Confrontation: The Truth or the Lie
        * Endings: Multiplicity of Madness
2. Branching Narrative System
    * Choice-based progression
    * Diverging story paths based on decisions
    * Conditional branching based on sanity levels
    * Multiple endings per storyline
Gameplay Mechanics
1. Sanity Meter
    * Visual representation (0-100 scale)
    * Dynamic changes based on player choices
    * Affects available options (choices locked/unlocked based on sanity)
    * Visual effects that intensify as sanity decreases
2. Choice System
    * Standard choices affecting narrative progression
    * "Are you truly sure?" moments for critical decisions
    * Rare permadeath paths in specific bad endings
3. Typewriter Text Effect
    * Characters appear sequentially with timing control
    * Skippable with "Skip" button
    * Sound effects synchronized with text appearance
UI/UX Design
1. Game Interface
    * Dark, Gothic-inspired design (Vampyr, Dark Souls 3, Valheim influences)
    * Start screen with storyline selection
    * Game screen with narrative text and choice buttons
    * Always-visible sanity meter
    * Responsive design for mobile and desktop
2. Visual Effects
    * Text distortion effects for low sanity
    * Subtle animations for environmental elements
    * Visual feedback for sanity changes
Audio Design
1. Sound System
    * Ambient background sounds (wind, whispers, echoes)
    * Event-triggered sound effects
    * Typewriter clicking sounds
    * Dynamic audio that responds to sanity level
4. Implementation Approach
Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Create core Löve2D files
2. Set up game state management
3. Implement basic UI components
4. Create React wrapper for Löve2D integration
Phase 2: Narrative Engine
1. Implement the story data structure
2. Build the typewriter text effect system
3. Create the choice rendering system
4. Implement sanity mechanics
Phase 3: Content Creation
1. Complete the first storyline "Whispers in the Walls"
2. Add ambient sounds and effects
3. Implement visual feedback effects
4. Build start screen and story selection
Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Connect to existing sidebar navigation
2. Test across different devices
3. Optimize performance
4. Add finishing touches and polish
5. Technical Requirements
Löve2D Implementation
* Core game logic in Lua
* Asset management for sounds and visuals
* State management for game progression
Web Integration
* HTML5 Canvas for Löve2D rendering
* React component wrapper
* Responsive design considerations
6. Storyline Details
I'll develop five distinct storylines as specified:
1. Whispers in the Walls (Haunted house narrative)
    * Theme: Inherited evil and ancestral corruption
    * Sanity focus: Paranoia and distrust of one's senses
2. The Looking Glass (Identity horror)
    * Theme: Fractured self and doppelgangers
    * Sanity focus: Deteriorating sense of self
3. Beneath the Skin (Body horror)
    * Theme: Transformation and physical corruption
    * Sanity focus: Fear of one's own body
4. Cold Embrace (Psychological isolation)
    * Theme: Winter isolation and temporal distortion
    * Sanity focus: Reality slippage and time perception
5. The Watching Woods (Environmental horror)
    * Theme: Nature's malevolence and ancient evil
    * Sanity focus: Primal fears and natural corruption
Each storyline will follow the 5-part narrative structure outlined in your text, with increasing psychological horror elements.
7. Next Steps
1. Set up the Löve2D environment and core files
2. Create the first storyline's complete narrative flow
3. Implement the sanity meter and typewriter effect
4. Integrate with the existing web application
5. Test gameplay flow and user experience
