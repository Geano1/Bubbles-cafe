It looks like your WordPress site is hosted at BubbleTeaMeiMei. If your horror story website is having trouble fetching content from this site, follow these troubleshooting steps tailored to your setup:

1. Check If the WordPress API is Enabled

Open your browser and enter:

https://bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts

	•	If you see JSON data, the API is working.
	•	If you get an error, the API may be blocked by WordPress.com settings or plugins.

2. Adjust API Permissions for WordPress.com

Since your site is on WordPress.com (not self-hosted), API access may be limited. Try:
	•	Logging into WordPress.com > Settings > General and ensuring “Allow REST API access” is enabled.
	•	If you’re using Jetpack, go to Jetpack > Settings > Writing and make sure the REST API is not restricted.

3. Fetch API Data in Your Frontend

Try fetching posts from your WordPress API with JavaScript:

fetch('https://bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching posts:', error));

	•	If this fails, check your browser console (F12 > Console) for errors.

4. Check for CORS Issues (If Fetching from Another Domain)

If your horror site is separate from WordPress, you might hit a CORS policy error. WordPress.com doesn’t let you edit .htaccess, so instead:
	•	Use a proxy server to fetch data.
	•	Or use a server-side request (Node.js backend) to fetch WordPress data and send it to your frontend.

Example (Node.js backend fetch function):

import fetch from 'node-fetch';

export async function getPosts(req, res) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts');
    const data = await response.json();
    res.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch WordPress posts' });
  }
}

This avoids CORS errors by fetching on the server instead of the browser.

5. Use WordPress.com API Authentication (If Needed)

If the API is restricted, you might need an API key:
	•	Go to https://developer.wordpress.com/ and get a free API key.
	•	Fetch posts with authentication:

fetch('https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com/posts/', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key.

6. Test API in Postman or cURL

Try running this in Postman or Terminal:

curl -X GET "https://bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"

	•	If it works in Postman but not in your frontend, it’s a CORS issue.
	•	If it fails, your WordPress API is restricted or down.

Next Steps:
	1.	Test https://bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts in your browser.
	2.	Try fetching with JavaScript (fetch() function).
	3.	Check for CORS errors.
	4.	If restricted, get an API key from WordPress.com.
	5.	If still failing, let me know the exact error message you see in the console!
