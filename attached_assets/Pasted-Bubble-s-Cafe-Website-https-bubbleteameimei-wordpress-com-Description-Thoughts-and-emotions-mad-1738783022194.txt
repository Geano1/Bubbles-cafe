A lady is in overly thin clothes and makeup that clearly does not hold up under the rain. With non-waterproof mascara dripping down her pale face, her once-beautiful features are forced to look horrible. Descent Date Published: Sat, 20 Aug 2022 16:22:25  Author: vantalison Link: Descent Excerpt: Have you ever wanted to feel what dying feels like? Do you want to? I can help you, picture this- You’re lying face up in a pile of garbage. It rained recently so an earthy scent lingers in the choking smell of garbage. Chase Date Published: Thu, 08 Sep 2022 19:15:02  Author: vantalison Link: Chase Excerpt: You look different today. The ol’ dark outfit has been swapped out for a brighter, sunnier look. I like it. You’re usually 5 steps behind me, matching my pace when I speed up and peeping when I turn a corner. Tunnel Date Published: Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:11:17  Author: vantalison Link: Tunnel Excerpt: I chose you. I’ve seen you walk this path a dozen times, your head bowed and your gait sluggish. You’re a 9 to 5 slave, for people who don’t care about you or even know your name. Skin Date Published: Fri, 06 Jan 2023 19:03:04  Author: vantalison Link: Skin Excerpt: If beauty is only skin deep, then please may I have your skin? If I ask politely will you give it to me? You refused- now I have no choice but to take it by force. Doll Date Published: Tue, 17 Jan 2023 21:41:29  Author: vantalison Link: Doll Excerpt: She appeared the day you left, right where you sat previously. She won’t be able to bring you back. I won’t let it happen. Cookbook Date Published: Tue, 17 Jan 2023 21:41:22  Author: vantalison Link: Cookbook Excerpt: I’m starting a cookbook. I’m working on my first recipe and I’ve already gotten the ingredients ready. I combine breadcrumbs soaked in milk with minced garlic and onion and set aside. Car Date Published: Sun, 05 Mar 2023 17:15:03  Author: vantalison Link: Car Excerpt: As I stand alone at the deserted bus stop, I can’t help but feel vulnerable and exposed in the darkness. That's when you appear, a stranger who offers to drive me home. Mirror Date Published: Thu, 09 Mar 2023 20:41:08  Author: vantalison Link: Mirror Excerpt: I’m observing you. You’re blabbering on the phone with your friends, talking about things I can’t hear clearly. Come closer. I very much want to listen in. Drive Date Published: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 22:33:26  Author: vantalison Link: Drive Excerpt: I can’t drive. If I learnt how to, then the first thing I would do is to run over a pedestrian. I’d put the car in reverse and run them over once more. Bug Date Published: Tue, 09 May 2023 13:08:58  Author: vantalison Link: Bug Excerpt: You can feel it crawling under your skin, a lump. It never stays in the same place for too long, constantly moving. The doctors say it’s all in your mind, formication they call it. Machine Date Published: Tue, 30 May 2023 18:25:37  Author: vantalison Link: Machine Excerpt: I am in the empty corridors of an abandoned research facility, surrounded by silence. Once filled with the hum of scientific progress, now it lies in ruins. Bleach Date Published: Sat, 24 Jun 2023 19:34:50  Author: vantalison Link: Bleach Excerpt: Do you want to end it all? Drink bleach then! It burns? Of course it does. You’ve lost your sense of taste and your tastebuds are burnt useless? Therapist Date Published: Sat, 24 Jun 2023 19:37:03  Author: vantalison Link: Therapist Excerpt: You’ve come in again today for your session. You’re laying on my coffee colored couch telling me your fears, your thoughts. You’re afraid of the dark, you tell me. Cave Date Published: Mon, 22 Apr 2024 20:15:27  Author: vantalison Link: Cave Excerpt: Journal Entry - May 21, 2004. For the past five months I have been exploring the perimeter of the caves. They fascinate me. I’m enticed to explore within. Nostalgia Date Published: Fri, 12 Jul 2024 22:05:24  Author: vantalison Link: Nostalgia Excerpt: Nostalgia is disgusting. It is a slimy, writhing worm in your brain you can’t reach. A parasite that gnaws at your sanity.
