 */

// ==== Test Case 1: Basic Toggle Functionality ====
// 1. Open the reader page by clicking on any story from the homepage
// 2. Click on the story text (not on buttons or navigation elements)
// 3. Verify the top navigation header disappears
// 4. Verify the subtle indicator "↑ Tap to exit" appears at the top
// 5. Verify the other UI elements become subtle but remain visible
// Expected Result: The page enters distraction-free mode with minimal UI

// ==== Test Case 2: UI Elements Accessibility ====
// 1. With distraction-free mode active, hover over the font size buttons
// 2. Verify they become more visible on hover (opacity increases)
// 3. Test clicking on the font size buttons (they should still work)
// 4. Test clicking on navigation buttons (they should still work)
// Expected Result: UI elements remain functional while being visually subtle

// ==== Test Case 3: Exit Methods ====
// 1. Enter distraction-free mode by clicking on story text
// 2. Press the ESC key on keyboard
// 3. Verify distraction-free mode is exited
// 4. Enter distraction-free mode again
// 5. Click on the story text again
// 6. Verify distraction-free mode is exited
// Expected Result: Both ESC key and clicking on text again exit distraction-free mode

// ==== Test Case 4: Mobile Experience ====
// 1. Open the reader page on a mobile device or use browser developer tools to simulate mobile view
// 2. Tap on the story content to enter distraction-free mode
// 3. Verify the "↑ Tap to exit" indicator is appropriately sized for mobile
// 4. Verify controls are still accessible when needed
// 5. Tap story text again to exit distraction-free mode
// Expected Result: The feature works well on mobile with appropriate visual adjustments

// ==== Test Case 5: Initial Tooltip ====
// 1. Clear browser storage/cookies or use incognito mode
// 2. Open the reader page
// 3. Verify the tooltip appears at the bottom of the page
// 4. Verify it shows instructions for distraction-free mode
// 5. Verify it mentions ESC key to exit
// 6. Verify it disappears after a few seconds
// Expected Result: New users see clear instructions about the distraction-free feature

// ==== Test Case 6: Performance ====
// 1. Enter and exit distraction-free mode multiple times
// 2. Verify animations are smooth and don't cause layout shifts
// 3. Verify no console errors occur during transitions
// Expected Result: The feature performs well without causing performance issues
