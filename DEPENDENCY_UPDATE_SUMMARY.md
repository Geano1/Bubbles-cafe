## Installation Notes

Several libraries were installed using custom scripts due to the limitations of the Replit packager tool, particularly with handling path aliases such as @/components, @/lib, etc. The custom scripts include:

- fix-packager-tool.js
- install-remaining-packages.js
- fix-dependencies.js

These scripts ensure proper installation of dependencies and avoid timing out during installations of larger packages.

For examples of how to use these libraries, refer to:

- client/src/pages/libraries-demo.tsx - Demonstrations of various libraries
