/**
 * Multi-Speed Scroll Feature - Manual Testing Guide
 * 
 * This document provides instructions for manually testing the Multi-Speed Scroll feature,
 * which implements adaptive scrolling based on gesture speed throughout the website.
 * 
 * Feature Description:
 * - Flicking the page up/down scrolls quickly (like throwing a physical object)
 * - Slow dragging results in gentler, more controlled scrolling
 * - Visual indicators appear briefly to show current scroll speed
 * 
 * Testing Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Testing Mouse Wheel Scroll Speed Sensitivity
 *    - Open any page on the website with enough content to scroll
 *    - Test fast scrolling: Quickly scroll the mouse wheel in one motion
 *      ‚úì Expected: Page scrolls faster than normal with a speed multiplier
 *      ‚úì Expected: A vertical bar appears on the right, indicating fast scroll
 *    - Test slow scrolling: Slowly and deliberately scroll the mouse wheel
 *      ‚úì Expected: Page scrolls more gently than normal
 *      ‚úì Expected: A shorter vertical indicator appears, indicating gentle scrolling
 * 
 * 2. Testing Touch-Based Scrolling (Mobile/Tablet)
 *    - Open any page on a touch-enabled device
 *    - Test fast flick: Quickly flick up or down and release
 *      ‚úì Expected: Page continues scrolling with momentum after release
 *      ‚úì Expected: Scrolling speed is amplified based on flick velocity
 *    - Test slow drag: Touch and slowly drag up or down
 *      ‚úì Expected: Page scrolls precisely, with reduced velocity
 *      ‚úì Expected: Scrolling stops promptly when touch ends
 * 
 * 3. Testing Visual Feedback
 *    - Perform fast scrolls and slow scrolls with pauses between them
 *      ‚úì Expected: Visual indicators appear only during active scrolling
 *      ‚úì Expected: Indicators disappear after a short period of inactivity
 *    - Verify that indicators are subtle and don't interfere with content
 * 
 * 4. Testing on Different Content Types
 *    - Test on pages with different layouts:
 *      - Text-heavy pages (like reader pages)
 *      - Image galleries
 *      - Dashboard/admin pages
 *    - Verify the behavior is consistent across different content types
 * 
 * 5. Testing Reduced Motion Setting
 *    - Enable "Reduce motion" in your device's accessibility settings
 *      ‚úì Expected: Adaptive scrolling should still work but with less dramatic effects
 *      ‚úì Expected: Visual indicators might be disabled or simplified
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Scrolling behavior feels natural and intuitive, matching physical expectations
 * - Fast gestures result in amplified scrolling distance
 * - Slow gestures result in precise, controlled movement
 * - Visual indicators provide subtle feedback about current scroll mode
 * - Feature respects user's accessibility preferences
 * 
 * Note: This feature enhances user experience by making scrolling feel more 
 * physically intuitive, similar to how objects move in the real world.
