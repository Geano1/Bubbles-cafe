/**
 * Manual Verification Checklist for Comment Flag Dialog
 * 
 * This document outlines what to manually check to verify the comment flag dialog functionality.
 * 
 * Feature Overview:
 * - Added confirmation dialog before flagging comments
 * - Tracks flagged comments in localStorage to prevent multiple flags
 * - Shows visual indicators for already flagged comments
 * 
 * Testing Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Initial State - Before Flagging
 *    - Load a story page with comments
 *    - Verify that comments show flag icons
 *    - Verify that no comments show "Reported" state
 * 
 * 2. Dialog Interaction
 *    - Click on a flag icon next to a comment
 *    - Verify that a confirmation dialog appears with:
 *      - Clear title "Report this comment?"
 *      - Explanatory text about moderation
 *      - "Cancel" and "Report Comment" buttons
 *    - Click "Cancel" and verify the dialog closes without action
 *    - Click flag icon again, then click "Report Comment"
 *    - Verify a toast notification appears confirming the report
 * 
 * 3. After Flagging - Visual State
 *    - Verify the flagged comment now shows "Reported" text instead of the flag button
 *    - Reload the page and verify the "Reported" state persists (localStorage working)
 * 
 * 4. Repeat Flagging Prevention
 *    - Try to flag the same comment again by manipulating the DOM
 *    - Verify that clicking on a reported comment's area doesn't trigger the dialog
 * 
 * 5. Multiple Comments
 *    - Flag a different comment
 *    - Verify both comments show "Reported" state
 *    - Reload and verify both stay in "Reported" state
 * 
 * 6. Reply Flagging
 *    - Flag a reply to a comment
 *    - Verify the reply shows a reported state
 *    - Verify it's stored correctly in localStorage
 * 
 * 7. Edge Cases
 *    - Test with localStorage disabled/cleared
 *    - Verify graceful handling of invalid localStorage data
 *
 * Expected Results:
 * - Dialog appears correctly with proper content
 * - Once flagged, comments show "Reported" visual state
 * - Flagged state persists across page reloads
 * - Each comment can only be flagged once
 * - System handles both comments and replies correctly
