/**
 * Global Gentle Return Feature - Manual Testing Guide
 * 
 * This document provides instructions for manually testing the Global Gentle Return feature,
 * which remembers and restores your scrolling position across the entire website.
 * 
 * Feature Description:
 * - Automatically saves your scroll position on every page you visit
 * - Seamlessly restores your position when you return to a page
 * - Uses special animations and indicators for page refreshes versus normal returns
 * - Highlights the paragraph near your reading position to help you find your place
 * 
 * Testing Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Testing Position Save & Restore on Navigation
 *    - Open any content page (e.g., a story, the homepage, etc.)
 *    - Scroll down significantly (at least 30% down the page)
 *    - Navigate to a different page (e.g., click a link in the navigation)
 *    - Use the back button to return to the original page
 *      ‚úì Expected: Your scroll position should be automatically restored
 *      ‚úì Expected: A subtle animation should smoothly scroll you to your previous position
 *      ‚úì Expected: A toast notification saying "Welcome Back" should appear
 * 
 * 2. Testing Position Save & Restore on Page Refresh
 *    - Open any content page and scroll down significantly
 *    - Stay on the page for at least 2-3 seconds (allowing auto-save to trigger)
 *    - Refresh the page (F5 or browser refresh button)
 *      ‚úì Expected: Your scroll position should be restored more quickly than with navigation
 *      ‚úì Expected: A toast notification with "Position Restored" and a refresh icon appears
 *      ‚úì Expected: The paragraph at your reading position should briefly highlight
 *      ‚úì Expected: A visual indicator shows "Returning to your previous position..."
 * 
 * 3. Testing Long-Term Position Memory
 *    - Open a content page and scroll to a specific position
 *    - Close the browser completely
 *    - Reopen the browser and navigate to the same page
 *      ‚úì Expected: Your scroll position should still be restored (persists across sessions)
 * 
 * 4. Testing Multiple Pages
 *    - Visit several different pages and scroll to different positions on each
 *    - Navigate through these pages using back/forward buttons
 *      ‚úì Expected: Each page should remember its own unique scroll position
 * 
 * 5. Testing Exclusion Paths
 *    - Verify that certain paths do not save positions (e.g., admin, login, etc.)
 *      ‚úì Expected: Scrolling on these pages should not be remembered
 * 
 * 6. Testing With Different Scrolling Speeds
 *    - Test position restoration after using both fast scroll and slow scroll features
 *      ‚úì Expected: Position should be restored correctly regardless of how you reached it
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Scroll positions are saved automatically across the entire website
 * - Positions are restored smoothly with appropriate visual feedback
 * - Different restoration animations for refresh vs. navigation
 * - Visual indicators help users understand what's happening
 * - Toast notifications confirm the feature is working
 * 
 * Note: This feature builds on the Reader-specific Gentle Return feature but extends
 * it to work across the entire website, creating a seamless reading experience
 * as users navigate through different pages.
