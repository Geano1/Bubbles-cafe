/**
 * Enhanced Gentle Return Feature - Manual Testing Guide
 * 
 * This document provides instructions for manually testing the enhanced Gentle Return feature,
 * which intelligently restores a user's reading position after they refresh the page or
 * return to the site after some time away.
 * 
 * Testing Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Open the reader page for any story (e.g., /reader/nostalgia)
 * 
 * 2. Scroll down to create reading progress
 *    - Scroll down through the content until you're at least 25% through the story
 *    - Wait a few seconds to ensure the progress is auto-saved (happens after 2 seconds of inactivity)
 *    - You may see a "Progress Saved" toast notification
 * 
 * 3. Verify reading progress has been saved
 *    - Open browser console (F12 > Console)
 *    - Run: Object.keys(localStorage).find(k => k.startsWith('readingProgress_'))
 *    - You should see a key like "readingProgress_nostalgia"
 *    - Run: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("readingProgress_nostalgia"))
 *    - You should see an object with scrollPosition, percentRead, etc.
 * 
 * 4. Refresh the page
 *    - Press F5 or the refresh button in your browser
 *    - The page should reload and then:
 *      a) Show a brief visual indicator ("Returning to your previous position...")
 *      b) Perform a staged, natural-feeling scroll back to your position
 *      c) Display a toast with "Reading Position Restored" and a spinning refresh icon
 *      d) Briefly highlight the paragraph where you left off
 * 
 * 5. Verify position was restored
 *    - You should not be at the top of the page
 *    - Your previous scroll position should be restored
 *    - The text paragraph near your reading position should have a subtle highlight that fades away
 *    - Scrolling and all UI interactions should work normally
 * 
 * 6. Testing Different Refresh Scenarios
 *    - Fast Refresh: Quickly refresh the page to test immediate position restoration
 *    - Close/Reopen: Close the tab completely, then revisit the same URL
 *    - Different Device Width: Change your browser width before/after refresh
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Progress is saved automatically after scrolling and brief inactivity (2 seconds)
 * - Position is restored with a smooth, staged scrolling animation after page refresh
 * - The scroll animation is faster on refresh than on regular return visits
 * - User receives visual feedback (toast message + paragraph highlight)
 * - Special indicators are shown specifically for refresh-based restoration
 * - The experience feels natural and helpfully guides the user back to their spot
 * 
 * Note: This feature enhances user experience by eliminating the frustration 
 * of losing reading position after a page refresh or when returning to a story,
 * while providing appropriate visual cues to orient the user.
