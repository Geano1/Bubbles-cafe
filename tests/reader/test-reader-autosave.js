   READER PAGE SPEED-BASED AUTO-SAVE TEST
===============================================

To test the auto-save functionality:

1. Open the reader page in your browser:
   http://localhost:3001/reader/nostalgia

2. Open the browser DevTools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)

3. Go to the Console tab in DevTools

4. Run this command to clear any existing saved progress:
   localStorage.removeItem('readingProgress_nostalgia'); localStorage.removeItem('readingProgress_post-6');

5. Reload the page

6. Test scenario #1 - Inactivity detection:
   - Scroll down slowly about halfway through the content
   - Stop scrolling completely and wait 3 seconds
   - Watch for a "Progress Saved" notification in the UI
   - Check localStorage by running this in the console:
     localStorage.getItem('readingProgress_nostalgia') || localStorage.getItem('readingProgress_post-6')

7. Test scenario #2 - Significant scroll change:
   - Perform a large, quick scroll (jump down a significant portion of the page)
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Check localStorage again to see if the progress percentage increased

8. Test scenario #3 - Horror easter egg:
   - Click the next/previous story buttons rapidly (at least 3 times within 1.5 seconds)
   - Watch for the "I SEE YOU SKIPPING!!!" horror message in pure red (#ff0000)

The auto-save feature should:
- Save progress automatically when scrolling stops for 2+ seconds
- Save progress when significant scroll changes occur (5%+ of page)
- Display a toast notification that says "Progress Saved" with the percentage
- Not show notifications too frequently (max once per 30 seconds)
