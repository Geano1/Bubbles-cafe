ENHANCED COMMENT SECTION - MANUAL TEST CHECKLIST
===============================================

Follow this guide to verify all implemented comment features:

1. COLLAPSIBLE COMMENTS
   ✓ Locate the "Collapse All" button at the top of the comment section
   ✓ Click the button to collapse all comments
   ✓ Verify that comments collapse with a smooth animation
   ✓ Verify that ChevronDown icons appear on collapsed comments
   ✓ Click "Expand All" to restore all comments
   ✓ Try collapsing/expanding individual comment threads using their icons

2. DYNAMIC COMMENT SORTING
   ✓ Find the sort dropdown in the comment section header
   ✓ Click to open the dropdown menu
   ✓ Select "Most Active" to sort comments by activity
   ✓ Verify that comments reorder with the most active threads at the top
   ✓ Try other sorting options: "Newest First" and "Oldest First"
   ✓ Confirm that comments reorder appropriately for each option

3. AUTO-SAVE DRAFT FUNCTIONALITY
   ✓ Start typing a comment in the comment box
   ✓ Type at least a few sentences and wait 3 seconds
   ✓ Refresh the page
   ✓ Verify that your comment text is automatically restored
   ✓ Check localStorage to see the saved draft (localStorage.getItem("comment_draft_X"))
   ✓ Submit or clear the comment to remove saved draft

4. AUTO-COLLAPSE ON SCROLL
   ✓ With comments expanded, scroll down significantly past the comment section
   ✓ Wait approximately 1.5 seconds without scrolling back up
   ✓ Verify that a toast notification appears saying "Comments minimized"
   ✓ Scroll back up to the comments and verify they are now collapsed
   ✓ Click to expand them again

5. RESURRECTED THREAD STYLING
   ✓ Look for comments with a "Resurrected" badge
   ✓ These should be threads that were inactive for over a year
   ✓ Verify the visual styling is distinct (different background color)
   ✓ Verify that the timestamp shows the resurrection date
   ✓ Confirm that newer replies within these threads have standard styling

Additional tests:
- Try using the "Reply" feature on any comment
- Check that your username is automatically populated
- Test @mentions in the reply field
- Verify that flagging a comment shows the confirmation dialog

Environment Requirements:
- Application must be running locally at http://localhost:3001
- Navigate to a post with existing comments (e.g., /posts/6)
- Ensure you're logged in to test authenticated features
