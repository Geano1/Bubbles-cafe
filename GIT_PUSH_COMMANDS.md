# Git Push Commands with Your Token

## Commands to Run Locally

Since Git operations are restricted in this environment, copy and paste these exact commands on your local machine:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project directory (after downloading/cloning locally)
cd interactive-storytelling-platform

# 2. Check current git status
git status

# 3. Add your GitHub repository with token authentication
git remote add origin https://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@github.com/corpse777/interactive-storytelling-platform.git

# 4. Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# 5. Check what branch you're on
git branch

# 6. If you have uncommitted changes, add and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Final updates before GitHub push"

# 7. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If 'main' doesn't work, try 'master':
# git push -u origin master
```

## Alternative: Set Token as Environment Variable

For better security, you can also set your token as an environment variable:

```bash
# Set token (Linux/Mac)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=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

# Set token (Windows)
set GITHUB_TOKEN=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

# Then use regular HTTPS URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/corpse777/interactive-storytelling-platform.git

# Git will prompt for username (use your GitHub username) and password (use the token)
git push -u origin main
```

## What Will Be Pushed

Your repository will contain:
- Complete React + TypeScript frontend
- Express.js backend with PostgreSQL  
- WordPress integration system
- Admin dashboard and authentication
- Database schema and setup scripts
- Security middleware and features
- Comprehensive documentation (README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, LICENSE)

2. You can set up deployments using the DEPLOYMENT.md guide
3. The project is ready for production use

## Troubleshooting

- **Token expired**: Generate a new token at GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
- **Repository doesn't exist**: Make sure you created it at https://github.com/new
- **Branch issues**: Try 'master' instead of 'main' if you get branch errors
- **Permission denied**: Ensure your token has 'repo' scope permissions

**Just run the commands above on your local machine and your project will be on GitHub!**
